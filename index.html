          <li>The Head element contains information about the webpage that the user cannot see such as metadata, which is used by the browser, search engines, and other developers behind the scenes.</li>

          <li>The Body element contains the visible content of the webpage shown to the user.  This includes tagged elements such as headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, images, anchor elements (which are used to create hyperlinks), and the line breaks that are sometimes placed between these elements.</li>

          <li>Tags can have attributes within them.  An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element, and are always defined in the beginning tag of an element, never the closing tag.</li>
