        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The Head element contains information about the webpage that the user cannot see such as metadata, which is used by the browser, search engines, and other developers behind the scenes.</li>

          <li>The Body element contains the visible content of the webpage shown to the user.  This includes tagged elements such as headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, images, anchor elements (which are used to create hyperlinks), and the line breaks that are sometimes placed between these elements.</li>

          <li>The Footer element typically contains authorship information, copyright information, contact information, sitemap, and related documents.</li>

          <li>Tags can have attributes within them.  An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element, and are always defined in the beginning tag of an element, never the closing tag.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are 3 types of CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS Style Sheet, and External CSS Style Sheet.</li>

          <li>Inline CSS applies to a specific HTML tag from within the HTML file itself to style only a particular page element.</li>

          <li>Internal Style Sheets are entire style sheets that are embedded directly into the HTML file using a Style element within the Head element.  The rules only apply to that page.</li>

          <li>External Style Sheets are a separate CSS file which is linked to the HTML file via a Link element.  This is the most common method as it maintains Separation of Concerns.</li>

          <li>Selector: Defines the element or atrributes to which rules or declarations will apply.</li>

          <li>Declarations: Comprised of two components; property and value.  Property is what we want to modify about the selector, and value is in what way we want to modify it.  (Example "color: blue")</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

          <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>cd (directory name): moves you between nearby directories in gitbash command line</li>

          <li>cd .. : Moves you back up one directory.</li>

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>

          <li>git checkout -b (branch name): creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

          <li>git branch: Lets you see what branches are available.</li>

          <li>git add -A: Commits all files in the current working branch.</li>

          <li>git commit -m "associated message here": Commits changes to repository with a descriptive message about the changes.</li>

          <li>git pull origin main: Pulls the base remote branch to ensure the current local branch is up to date.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Variables are named containers that allow us to store data.</li>

          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.  In JavaScript, code runs from top to bottom.</li>

          <li>Conditional statements and loops can be used to control the order in which code is executed, or not executed.</li>

          <li>If Statements are a type of conditional statement that will execute code only if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>

          <li>The Strict Equality Operator (===) is used to check if two values are equal and returns a boolean result of true or false.</li>

          <li>An Array is a single variable that is used to contain a set of multiple pieces of data, which are indexed in order starting from zero.</li>

          <li>a For Loop is a type of loop which uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task repeatedly on all of the items in an array.</li>
